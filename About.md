## 🛠️ Projects
- **Project 1**: Disease detection in Sugarcane Plant
  
Developed a plant disease detection model leveraging the InceptionV3 architecture for feature extraction and classification. Trained on a curated dataset of sugarcane plant leaf images to identify multiple diseases. Achieved an overall accuracy of 96%, demonstrating high reliability in early disease diagnosis.
  
- **Project 2**: Optimizing Connectivity for Massive machine-type communication

Developed a connectivity optimization framework for massive machine-type communication (mMTC) using an ensemble of LSTM models to predict key network parameters such as bandwidth and latency. Trained on time-series data from diverse IoT application domains, the ensemble approach enhanced prediction robustness and achieved over 90% accuracy, enabling intelligent network slicing and efficient resource allocation.
