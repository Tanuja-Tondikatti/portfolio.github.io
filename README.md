## Business Cases
<img src="Statistics.jpeg" alt="Number of Users" width="600" height="300"/>

This Bar graph illustrates the current competitive landscape of desktop browsers. Despite being built on the same Chromium engine, Google Chrome vastly dominates, while Microsoft Edge, though second, captures only about 1/5 of Chrome's market. Despite being faster and more integrated with Windows 11, Edge is not widely adopted. This exposes both a challenge and a business opportunity for Microsoft. If Edge wins even 10% of Chrome‚Äôs share, it would gain ~6.5%, increasing its total to ~20%. This makes Edge a major challenger brand, opening monetization opportunities (e.g., Bing Ads, shopping tools).

To achieve this objective, it is essential to identify and resolve critical technical bottlenecks that hinder both user adoption and browser performance. By Leveraging advanced data structures and algorithms can enhance the browser‚Äôs speed, responsiveness, and resource management.

# 1. Autofill System 

### üîç Autocomplete with Trie
Uses a **prefix tree (Trie)** to quickly find form entries that match user input as they type.  
**Example:** Typing `tan` instantly suggests `tanuja@example.com`.

### üî° Typo Correction via BK-Tree
Implements a **BK-Tree (Burkhard-Keller Tree)** for fuzzy string matching using edit distance.  
**Example:** If a user types `emial`, it still suggests `email`.

### üìà Suggestion Ranking with Min/Max Heaps
Uses **heaps** (priority queues) to prioritize autofill suggestions based on **recency** or **frequency** of use.  
**Example:** Emails or names used more often appear at the top of suggestions.

### üë§ Session-Based Isolation with Disjoint Set Union
Uses **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)** to isolate autofill data between normal and incognito sessions.  
**Example:** No suggestions from regular mode appear in private mode.

### üß© Flexible Form Mapping via Bipartite Graphs
Matches form input fields to their correct labels using **bipartite graph algorithms**.  
**Useful when:** Websites use non-standard form layouts or custom naming conventions.

## Data Structure And Algorithm analysis
###  Trie
<img src="Images\Triedatastructure1.png" alt="Trie" width="500" height="400"/>

Tries enhance search functionality by providing predictive text suggestions as users type queries in Edge. Also known as submission throttling.  
Tree data structure, Prefix tree

- **Time Complexity**: O(L) for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations, where L is the length of the key (typically a word)  
- **Space Complexity**: O(ALPHABET_SIZE √ó L), where ALPHABET_SIZE is the number of possible characters and L is the length of the key

###   BK-Tree
<img src="Images\BK.jpg" alt="BK" width="500" height="400"/>

BK-Trees support typo-resilient search by allowing approximate matches based on edit distances.  
Commonly used for spelling correction, fuzzy matching, and autofill systems (e.g., suggesting ‚Äúemail‚Äù when user types ‚Äúemial‚Äù).  
Tree data structure built using metric spaces (like Levenshtein distance).

- **Time Complexity**: O(log N) for search in a balanced BK-Tree, where N is the number of words  
- **Space Complexity**: O(N √ó L), where N is the number of stored words and L is the average word length

###  Priority Queue

Used for ranking autofill suggestions by recency or frequency. Efficiently retrieve top suggestions (e.g., most frequently used form input).
- **Time Complexity:** O(log N) for insertion and deletion
- **Space Complexity:** O(N)

# 2. Page Loading Optimization

Page loading is a critical factor in browser performance. Efficient use of data structures and algorithms improves rendering speed, responsiveness, and perceived performance. Improve the speed at which a webpage is parsed, resources are fetched, and content is rendered.



## üîß Data Structures & Algorithms

| Data Structure / Algorithm | Purpose |
|----------------------------|---------|
| **Event Queue / Min Heap** | Efficient scheduling of tasks like scripts, animations, and painting frames |
| **Dependency Graph**       | Manage resource loading order (e.g., CSS before JS execution) |
| **Trie / HashMap**         | Fast URL resolution, DNS prefetching, and cache lookup |
| **LRU Cache**              | Efficient memory management of recently used resources (images, scripts) |
| **Segment Trees**          | Manage layout recalculations or animations across DOM sections |

---

### üß† Concepts
- **Critical Path Rendering**: Prioritize essential resources (HTML, CSS) using Dependency Graphs.
- **Lazy Loading**: Delays loading non-visible content using LRU strategy.
- **Preloading / Prefetching**: Use Tries and HashMaps to resolve likely next resources.

---

### Event Queue / Min Heap
<img src="Images\Min-Heap.webp" alt="Trie" width="500" height="400"/>
Min Heaps are used for scheduling tasks in the correct order of execution based on priority. For example, scripts that must run before rendering, layout recalculations, or frame paint tasks can be prioritized and executed using a min-heap task scheduler.

- **Time Complexity**: O(log N) for insertion and deletion
- **Space Complexity**: O(N)

- **Space Complexity**: O(ALPHABET_SIZE √ó L)
  
[View code here](codes\Trie.cpp)

### LRU Cache
<img src="Images\LRU.jpg" alt="Trie" width="500" height="400"/>

Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache is applied for caching assets like images, scripts, or pages. It keeps the most recently accessed content readily available while evicting older, less-used resources when memory is constrained.

- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for get/put using hashmap + doubly linked list
- **Space Complexity**: O(N)
[View code here](codes\LRU.cpp)
### Segment Tree
<img src="Images\segment.png" alt="Trie" width="500" height="400"/>

Segment Trees allow efficient range updates and queries. They are useful when dynamically updating or querying DOM regions, animations, or styles in real-time as the user interacts with the page.

- **Time Complexity**: O(log N) for update/query
- **Space Complexity**: O(N)

# Optimizing Network Traffic in Microsoft Services
<img src="Images\Max.png" alt="BK" width="500" height="400"/>

Microsoft manages vast networks of servers and data centers to deliver its services. The Max Flow algorithms can be used to optimize network traffic flow, ensuring efficient data transmission and minimizing congestion. Max flow algorithms, such as Karger‚Äôs, Dinic‚Äôs, and Ford-Fulkerson, can assist in determining optimal routes and balancing the load across servers, improving system performance and reliability.

## Algorithms, Design Techniques, and Performance Analysis

### 1. Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
- **Approach:** Uses augmenting path method with a greedy approach to iteratively find paths from source to sink that can carry more flow.
- **Design Techniques:** Residual graph, BFS for path search (Edmonds-Karp variant).
- **Time Complexity:** O(E * V¬≤), where E = number of edges, V = number of vertices.
- **Space Complexity:** O(V¬≤).

### 2. Dinic‚Äôs Algorithm
- **Approach:** Uses a layered network to find blocking flows, speeding up the max flow computation compared to Ford-Fulkerson.
- **Design Techniques:** Level graph construction via BFS, blocking flow calculation via DFS.
- **Performance:** More efficient in practice, especially for dense graphs.

### 3. Karger‚Äôs Algorithm
- **Approach:** A randomized contraction algorithm based on the min-cut max-flow theorem.
- **Design Techniques:** Randomly contracts edges while preserving minimum cuts.
- **Performance:** Probabilistic guarantees, useful for min-cut problems and network reliability analysis.
  
These algorithms provide foundational tools for optimizing network traffic, enabling large-scale infrastructures like Google‚Äôs data centers to operate efficiently under heavy loads.
